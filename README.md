# AutoClicker
An auto clicker that closely resembles a human's inconsistencies and may be able to surpass some anti-cheat.
This auto clicker is currently in development and will only be used for experimental purposes.

The program runs for a certain number of clicks but can be changed longer by changing the CLICKS variable.
There are random timed pauses in between the press and release for the mouse. There are also random timed
pauses in between the clicks themselves. This is to help make the clicks more 'human' like.

The current CLICK number of 2000 takes approximately 35-40 minutes. On average each click takes a little over
1 second to complete. (60 cps) I chose 2000 clicks because I am experimenting with the online MMORPG Runescape.
I am using the 40-minute intervals as "breaks" for a person. I WILL have commented code that can be entered to
begin the loop again after an allotted break time.

Feel free to use this auto clicker at your OWN RISK. Auto clickers are against many of the terms of service
for most online games. It is an unfair advantage, and I advise that you to try to refrain from cheating.
